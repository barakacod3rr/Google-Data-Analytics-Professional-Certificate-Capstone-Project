# 🚦 Road Accidents in Kenya (2012–2023) Analysis  

This repository contains my end-to-end data analysis project exploring road crash data in Kenya (2012–2023).  

### 📌 Project Overview  
The goal was to uncover insights into **when, where, and how** road accidents occur, and provide data-driven recommendations for road safety interventions.  

**Tools Used:** Excel, R (tidyverse, lubridate, tmaptools), Tableau.  

**Key Learnings from the Data Analysis Course:**  
- Cleaning and transforming messy datasets using R.  
- Extracting insights from temporal and spatial accident data.  
- Storytelling with data using Tableau dashboards.  

### 🔍 Assumptions  
- The dataset does capture all the 47 counties in Kenya, just the counties that have major road networks  
- Reverse geocoding introduced minor location inaccuracies due to API limits.  
- Crash involvement by vehicle type is based on text-flag indicators (e.g., “contains_motorcycle_words”).  

### 📊 Outputs  
- R Markdown report with the full analysis pipeline: [🔗 View Analysis Process](ReportAnalysis.pdf)  
- Tableau Story dashboard (interactive): [🔗 View Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/TFKJT44G2?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  

### 📂 Files
